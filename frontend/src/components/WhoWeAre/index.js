            <p>
                Geaux Blue NOLA was first established in 2016 in response to tragic and senseless attacks against
                police officers in cities across the country including places like Dallas and Baton Rouge. The
                intent was to show public support and appreciation for NOPD officers while improving morale within
                the ranks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Both events were repeated in 2017 the last events to take place. In 2022 the need was
                recognized to once again show the support and appreciation for our hometown heroes, as the number
                of officers began to dwindle.

                Join us in showing your support for the New Orleans Police Department's officers and their
                families. We are pleased to announce that plans are well underway for both the third Geaux Blue
                Family Day and Geaux Blue NOLA Day. Past Geaux Blue NOLA events were widely adopted and supported
                by the public and the business community in past years. They were an amazing success and we hope
                to build on that momentum this year.

                NOPD officers are dedicated to providing our residents and visitors with the best public safety
                possible, sometimes under the most adverse and demanding circumstances. In addition, for every
                officer, there are family members that sacrifice holidays, nights, weekends, and family events so
                that their mothers, fathers and spouses may serve and protect us. Geaux Blue Family Day and
                Geaux Blue NOLA Day provide our community with an opportunity to show our appreciation to
                these officers and their families in a big way.
