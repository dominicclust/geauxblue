                    It's important for us to let our officers know that
                    we are aware of the struggles they face--the dangers
                    they face each day.

                <p>
                    The color blue is usually used to represent police and other
                    law enforcement officials and so many proudly wear blue
                    uniforms as a part of their job. Proudly display blue
                    ribbons, blue lights or blue flags on your home. or business
                    to show that you support. Wear blue shirts or ribbons to
                    show that you care.

                <h2>Obey the law</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the best ways to show your support for law
                    enforcement officials is to follow the laws of the
                    land. Should you find yourself called out for an
                    infraction of the law, treat them with respect and
                    courtesy. These are the men and women who risk their
                    lives everyday enforcing the laws that keep you safe.

                <h2>Thank an officer</h2>
                <p>
                    This simple act of kindness and respect can sometimes make
                    the difference in a police officer's day. So often it is a
                    thankless job and much of the interaction between the police
                    and the community is framed around negative events, but every
                    day, these men and women return to work to keep our streets safe. Simply letting an
                    officer know that you are thankful for their service to the
                    community can go a long way.

                Volunteer. Tutor. Support. Sponsor. For all of the difficulties we face, there
                are still tremendous resources of courage, good sense, faith, and commitment in every
                neighborhood. Communities strengthen when people decide to strengthen them. It
                is true that we are failing a generation of young, black children here in America.
                We can inspire progress by establishing connections with the next generation through
                patient tutoring, shared service, faith, and deep friendships.

                <p>
                    There are many law enforcement support organizations here in Louisiana. Our officers
                    risk their lives daily. Some have even lost their lives in the line of duty. You can
                    honor them by ensuring their memories live on and strengthen the profession in which
                    they served.
